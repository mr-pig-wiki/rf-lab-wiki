## Radio Frequency Laboratory of the Wald Group at MGH

This page contains resources for RF coil design, fabrication, and
testing related to the work conducted in the RF Lab of the [\| Magnetic
Resonance Physics and Instrument Group
(MR-PIGs)](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/mr-pig), led by Dr.
Lawrence Wald, at the A. A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging,
Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

*(August 2020): Version 1 of a low-cost Mini Circuits-based RF low noise
preamplifier added*

*(March 2020): A few small bugs have been fixed on the fiber optic
interface board. New versions of the board files are now available.*

*(July 2019): Revision C of the open-source shim amplifier are now
available online. Please see Current driver section below.*

*(JULY 2016): MATLAB code is now available for multi-coil shimming
simulations. The code includes helmet-style wire patterns and a
constrained optimization script for finding optimal shim currents for B0
shimming of the brain. Please see the*
