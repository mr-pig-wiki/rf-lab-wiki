# rf-lab-wiki
A migration/archive of the Martinos MR PIG RF Lab Wiki

- Exported MediaWiki pages as 1 .xml file using the built in export feature (Special pages: export) (note: the list of pages to export must match the page titles EXACTLY)
- Converted to Markdown format using https://github.com/philipashlock/mediawiki-to-markdown (note: this tool requires an older version of PHP, one that still has the 'each()' function     defined. PHP7.4 was used for this project.)
- pictures and pdfs (and any other uploaded files) from the original wikis have not been migrated yet, as I haven't found a more streamlined/automated process than just individually downloading them all then reuploading to github. UPDATE: files can be downloaded from Special pages: File list using a simple shell script (named 'download_all.sh' in this repo). This script also downloads the thumbnails from the File list page which all start with '180px' in the file name; these can be deleted after the fact, or can be avoided altogether by adding "| grep -v '/thumb/' \" in the script after "grep -o '/images/[^"]*' "$TMP_HTML" \".
8/21/25 - fixed file paths in reference links so now clicking on a page or image link takes you to the correct page/image*. this was done with a shell script (fix_file_links.sh). this script contains a step to delete all instances of /md_pages b/c I had to get rid of them from failed previous versions of the script. This script essentially changes the reference links for files/images to the form /your_files_folder/file_name from the MediaWiki form of File:file_name or Media:file_name, then appends '/your_page_folder' to the front of reference links to other pages (eg. '/page_name.md' becomes '/your_page_folder/page_name.md'). The other steps, like mentioned before, are for fixing what was done in previous iterations of the script.
